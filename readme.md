# 90 Days of code

The purpose of the repository is to give you a guide to training yourself to be an entry level web developer in 90 days. This guide is based that each day represents at least 8 hours of work between watch related videos and practicing the material. So by the time you are done with this course you should have put in approximately 720 hours of time in learning the skills to be a strong entry level candidate.

If you can't put in 8 hours a day then completing this may take more than 90 days but this should help calibrate your expectations with the pace at which you advance from one day to the next.
