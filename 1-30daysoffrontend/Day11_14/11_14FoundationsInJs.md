# 11-14 - Foundations in Javascript

Now that your HTML and CSS should be pretty comfortable the next step is to solidfy your foundations in Javascript programming so the next few days will be spent playing with the javascript from the console either via chrome developer tools or the console on codepen. The goal is to learn all the basic Javascript concepts and become comfortable coding in javascript before we begin applying deeper javascript usage to our website.

## Today's Assignments

Watch the video below, try to make a test project on codepen after each video using what you just learned. You have four days to watch and practice the material in these videos.

### Watch Tutorial Videos

Step 1 - Watch my entire tutorial on javascript basics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF-AdLnhj3I&list=PLY6oTPmKnKbZDZ9cRrRby4Wnr4GIJj5O3

* after watching this practice if statements and loops from a codepen project.

Step 2 - Watch this video on string methods: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRz0nbax0uI

* practice all 20 methods in a codepen project

Step 3 - Array and Array methods: 1 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQYgxZPtPLw 2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRgD1yVwIvE

* practice all methods taught in a codepen project

Step 4 - Functions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUI5Tsl2JpY

* create a function to generate a random number within a range, feel free to google how to generate random numbers in JS.

Step 5 - Javascript Objects: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs3F-z6ridc

Practice making javascript objects with functions, arrays, integers and strings as properties and practice calling and using those properties.

Step 6 - Object Oriented Programming in JAVASCRIPT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDJpGenyHaA

* practice create a class called fighter and then creating two instances of the fighter class that then fight each other with some randomness that'll lead to different results each time.
