# Day 1 - Setup Your Tools

The goal of this course is to you have a solid foundation in the knowledge an entry level web developer needs and the ability to use the right tools. Today the goal is to develop a comfort the primary tools and install them on your computer. Watch the related videos to get an idea how these tools will be used, a lot of the features of these tools may not make sense yet but will as we begin to create projects going forward.

## The Tools

Today's goal is to learn the tools you'll need and get a primer on how they work.

### Tool 1 - The Chrome Browser

You likely already have the chrome browser installed on your computer. The reason why we'll need chrome is to display our websites as they are being developed and make use of the chrome developer tools which will give us a bunch of information that'll help us develop our projects quicker.

### Tool 2 - Codepen

After your code is all edited and completed for different projects you should copy and paste it into a Codepen project so it can be seen live online. Think of Codepen as a way to build an online portfolio of your projects and exercises. A codepen account is free.

### Tool 3 - Git and Github

Git is for managing version of your code as your project develops and github allows you to make a copy of your codebase online that is freely available online. If you don't already have git, install it and clone this repository to your computer. Push the code to a copy on your own github and you can store the code and drills within this repository so you can track the work you'll do these 90 days.

### Tool 5 - Bash Command Line

Learning to work with the command line will be a must as a developer. If you are on mac or linux the bash command line will be already on your system, if you are on windows you'll need to install git-bash which you probably did when you installed git.
